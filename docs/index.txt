   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

===============================================
Welcome to pyramid_formalchemy's documentation!
===============================================

Installation
============

With easy_install::

  $ easy_install pyramid_formalchemy

It's also highly recommended to install fa.jquery to get a nicer interface::

  $ easy_install fa.jquery

Usage
======

Add an empty ``forms.py`` module at the root of your project.

Now you just need to include two line of configuration in the ``__init__.main()`` function of your project.
Here is the one used for testing:

.. literalinclude:: ../pyramidapp/pyramidapp/__init__.py

This will render the **basic** formalchemy interface.

It's better to enable the jquery stuff like this:

.. literalinclude:: ../../formalchemy_project/__init__.py


That's it. Now launch your app, browse ``/admin/`` and enjoy it !

Advanced usage
===============

In the toward examples we just pass a ``package`` parameter to
:func:`~pyramid_formalchemy.configure`.  By default the function will try to
load ``package.models`` ``package.models.DBSession`` and ``package.forms`` but
you can override this. In this case you don't need to specify a package::


    pyramid_formalchemy.configure(config,
                                  models='formalchemy_project.mymodels',
                                  session_factory='formalchemy_project.session.Session',
                                  forms='formalchemy_project',
                                  use_jquery=True)

You can also change the path ``prefix`` used. pyramid_formalchemy will use
``/admin/`` by default. See :func:`~pyramid_formalchemy.configure`.

Description: 
        This is a plugin for setup tools that enables Git integration.  Once
        installed, Setuptools can be told to include in a module distribution
        all the files tracked by git.  This is an alternative to explicit
        inclusion specifications with MANIFEST.in.
        
        This package was formerly known as gitlsfiles.  The name change is the
        result of an effort by the setuptools plugin developers to provide a
        uniform naming convention.
